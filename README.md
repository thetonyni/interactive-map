Getting an error?

- clone your group's final project repo in RStudio
- copy `_config.yml` and `index.Rmd` from our course-content repo (in the "final-project" folder) to your group's final project repo 
- push those files 
- knit `index.Rmd` and push the resulting files (which should include an `index.md` document and other index files)
